never the same\nchorus\nAnd the love of a woman ain't gonna save my sorry day\nI need something between just a near drink of beam and a river to sweep me away\nI ain't gonna share my bed so you can nod your head and tell me it will be okay\nchorus""Well you called but you never did knock\nWell you called but my ears they were busy and blocked\nSo I leaned on the door, fell asleep standing

outgrow my history\nWhen I die, leave a stone on my grave\nThat's the place to remember my face\nWhen I die, leave a stone on my grave\nLeave a stone on my grave to remember\nShe extended her laugh writing fiction in photographs\nFake 'cause it's tape, but more real than unseen\nThen she stares at her shape every day like a ghost\nWho's haunting his son before heaven\nThere are people I still like to know\nAnd I few who I wouldn't be sad to see go\nBut I'm stuck on an aisle that's charted and known\nAnd these bridges won't burn on their own\nOh and boy, baby boy only seventeen years seventeen\nOh and boy, baby boy, it's five less than me\nOh and I know so much less than it seems\nOh but I can admit to the nothing I've seen""When you go, take my coat with you\nSo when it snows

songs\n'Cause if you sang anyone else's you won't think of me for nearly\nAs long as I live I'll always find your socks in my bed\nMy bed, socks in my bed, my bed, my little bed\nI always find your socks in my bed, my bed\nI'll always find your socks in my bed\nAnd in the morning, whisper softly\n'Cause these walls are paper thing\nTake a pair of my Golden Toes\nAnd was them in your laundry and

suitcase by the train\nWhile city princes hail cabs to beat the rain\nStacks of books she never reads\nShe never begs\nThere's reservations on her mind and in her head\nI spend my days searching for my soul\nAnd as we roar along the truth is left untold\nI know my brother came and turned some heads before\nBut that was then\nAnd this is someone else's war\nCovered faces on the pictures and the news\nAre covered faces in my home and in my shoes\nA bigger stage should make it quicker than before\nBut now it's jeans not oily key that open doors\nAll the buildings are selling poison on the

your voice each time you talk\n'Cause I won't let your story speak a single law\nI dress you up, I'll write your history\nMake you tell your friends you miss me when I'm gone\nBut you don't wear those clothes\nAnd you just ain't nothing but a voice I chose\nSo I think I'll leave you blowing smoke rings out your window\n'Cause it's me I'm searching for\nBurning teeth, I'm pointing pistols at my chest cause I can't breathe\nAnd I might be tricking you but girl I sure ain't tricking me\nAnd this is something I should see through because I need to\nIs there more to you than me\nchorus\nIt ain't you and it ain't me\nWell it's nothing but the papers bens and fashion magazines\nIt ain't you\nAnd it ain't me\nWell it's nothing but the papers, pens, and fashion\nI poured a generous ration in my glass\nYou're the match and it's nothing but the gasoline\nIf you don't tell me I won't hear you\nIf you don't ask I'll never know\nSo for now let's both pretend to\nBut it sure ain't gonna grow""I

than this\nI wondered how so many could be in so much pain\nWhile others don't seem to feel a thing\nThen I curse my wiseness and I get so damned depressed\nIn a world of suffering, why should I be so blessed\nI heard about a woman who lives in Colorado\nShe built a monument of sorts behind her garage door\nWhere everyday she prays for all whom are born\nAnd all whose souls have passed on\nSometimes my trouble gets so thick\nI can't see how I'm gonna get through it\nBut then I would rather be stuck up in a tree\nThan be tied to it\nI know\nThere is so much more\nI don't feel

was hunted by the wolves and I was heckled by the crows\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\nAlongside my innocence I laid in bed awake\nConflicted and in chains with the impetus of age\nBut like a phantom she crept across the floor and out the window\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\nFrom its place on the mantel my heart was taken down\nScattered in a thousand little pieces on the ground\nAnd I below the street lamp like an orphan with a halo\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\n'cause it won't last, worriesll pass\nAll your troubles, they don't stand a chance\nAnd sometimes it takes more than a lifetime to know\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\nYour confidences fall as your faith etched in stone\nNeither could comfort you from the wild unknown\nSo bury your burning hatred like a hatchet in the snow\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\nIf you have a broken heart or a battered soul\nFind something to hold onto until they go\nTo help you through the hard nights like a flask filled with hope\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\n'cause it won't last, your worriesll pass\nAll your troubles, they don't stand a chance\nAnd it always hurts the worst when its the ones we love the most\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\nSometimes your path is marked in the sky\nSometimes it falls too thin in between the lines\nSometimes all that you can do is say 'No'\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\nI said when I arrived in my old set of clothes\nI was half a world away from my home\nAnd I was hunted by the wolves and I was heckled by the crows\nDarlin do not fear what you don't really know\nI said, darlin do not fear what you don't really know\nWe said, darlin do not

defined\nBy the fences put up around my mind\nI watched them thicken into walls over time\nTaller than any borderline\nI saw civilizations deemed insignificant\nI saw peoples history tattooed upon their skin\nI saw families taken from their land\nDynasty shattered and stolen\nAnd I asked when is the revolution\nI asked when is the revolution\nAnd all the burdens the centuries accrue\nThat get passed along to every generations youth\nAnd all the allegories told in lewd truth\nI watched them grow wild and spread like a flu\nI saw the rise of an untamed industry\nAnd I watched machines print a paper economy\nI saw my own self stand right in front of me\nAnd I didn't do a thing\nI saw poisons pushed in the street\nAnd prescription pills mingling in the mezzanine\nWith a whole wealth of doctors and pharmaceutical companies\nStill poor people were dying from disease\nAnd I asked when is the revolution\nI asked when is the revolution\nI asked when is the revolution\nI asked when is the revolution\nAnd I broke down at the break of dawn\nAnd saw looming in the clouds above the Pentagon\nAs he relives the holocaust as strong as the parkin' on\nVisions Incomprehensible Vietnam\nAnd I stood silent upon the flooded levee\nStared at the ruins of a merchant city\nAnd the president who came to dine with the noble, he\nHe didn't do a thing\nI saw three ships come sailing in\nThrough the passage of the Caribbean\nI saw children coming home in coffins\nMillions marching on Washington\nAnd I asked when is the revolution\nI asked when is the revolution\nI asked when, when is the

ones\nI've done haystacks and rich old ladies by their pools\nWearing nothing but a scarf\nI've painted everything there was to paint\nNow it was time to sit back, give interviews\nGet on the internet, hang out at club med\nTake stock of what I've done\nYou know, the best friend I ever had was a dog\nIt sounds like a cliche unless it's happened to you\nSome days that dog was the only reason I even got out of bed\nThat dog went everywhere with me and then I heard the crack addicts\nWere stealin' dogs and selling them for animal research\nIt sounded like an urban myth to me like the mouse in the Coke bottle\nBut I started leavin' her at home after that\nYou know, Paula was my wife for a while\nShe ran off to Paris with the great grandson of Van Gogh\nA cartoonist who did fashion

a conversation sometimes\nShe believed collage was the greatest of all the arts\nAnd was busy pasting pictures of horses, next to ads for laundry soap\nNext to Mohammed Ali, she had a turquoise in her ear\nAnd said Rachmaninoff was always in her head\nBut later that day I was trying to describe her to Jimmy the Wig\nI couldn't find any words and I realized I'd started to sketch her chin\nSomehow it didn't look right, I scratched it out and tried it again\nI filled an entire pad, I threw it away, I never even came close\nFor a six days I sat at Dino's place\nThe rain wouldn't quit and no one came in\nFinally on the seventh day it cleared and in she walked\nI asked her to sit with me and I bought her a cup of tea\nAnd I asked her to model for me sometime\nThat afternoon I was at a canvas\nShe was wearing a yellow dress\nI swore if she let me, I'd get it right\nI've painted over ten thousand paintings\nSad ones, funny ones, dark ones, and light ones\nBut sitting there, it was like I couldn't even write my own name\nI apologized and said, It's been a few months\nIf you have patience, I'll get the hang of it again\nIn the next few weeks, I painted her hundreds of times\nIf I get the nose right, the chin's too long\nIf I get 'em both right, the face is too thin\nBut I keep after it and one day I, I'll get it all right\nI painted a still life this morning, of a throat lozenge\nSitting on a copy of Tropic of Cancer\nThe only thing was funny is that\nI never thought I'd paint anything again\nI think I might go visit Estelle\nThose Utah mountains are good for the soul\nI'll bring my brushes and some Jack Daniels\nAnd we can make up for lost time\nAnd she said, Why baby, why baby, why baby why\nBaby why have you turned your back on love\nYou had so many chances\nWhy have you let 'em all go by\nAnd she says, Why baby, why baby, why baby why\nBaby why have you turned your back on love\nYou had so many chances\nWhy have you let 'em all go by\nSometimes

to study math\nAnd the Greeks found out about the path.\nIn case you wonder what else they did\nThe Alkebulans created the pyramids.\nAnd before Napoleon could even blink\nIn Alkebu there stood a

never had now you'll never have me back\nI bear a witness to your faults and that line's severely cracked\nYou're gonna live your life and stay on your side\nYou're not ashamed to try you're more afraid of why\nThis bridge is burning now it's caving in\nWe're never gonna win we'll run in circles till we fall in line""You don't have to believe me I'm just speaking my mind\nYou look lovely as always you get that all the time\nYou don't have to believe me when I tell you that I'm impressed\nBut you sure better believe me when I say you deserve the best\nYou don't have to believe me but I'm not gonna lie\nI've seen all the attention you get from other guys\nYou don't have to believe me when I tell you I like your dress\nBut you sure better believe me when I say you deserve respect\nChorus\nIt feels like nobody's on your side no access to your pride\nYou gotta learn to take control your whole body is a temple so\nYou've got a choice to make and your mind is what's at stake\nSo before we build this love please believe that you're good enough\nYou don't have to believe me but I'm not often wrong\nThey've been taking advantage and it's gone on too long\nYou don't have to believe me when we're dancing out on the floor\nBut you sure better believe me when I say you are worth much more\nChorus\nYou don't have to believe me\nBut you sure better believe me when I tell you you're due for love\nI don't want nobody else\nAnd nobody else is gonna treat you the way they ought to\nAnd that's what you deserve\nIf I could make you see it\nSo you can truly believe it\nSo you won't even need it\nYou don't have to believe me when\nYou're shaking what you got\nBut you sure better believe me when\nI tell you your mind's what's hot.""Long as I am erasing this there's something I am bound to miss\nOpportunities exist but often don't arise\nAnd think of how it must have felt to watch you walk away and melt\nI keep it all inside myself and in between my eyes\nAnd it's no surprise what we've become\nSince the arrival has begun\nIt hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright\nI'm only concerned with the way we end up\nI think I've been wrong enough to know when I'm right\nSo put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone\nIt hasn't been long enough\nI feel as if I spoke too soon and ruined the whole afternoon\nA feeling that we're more than doomed is creeping up inside\nAnd good as it was bound to be there's something about you and me\nIt's negative in chemistry which makes it hard to hide\nAnd it's no surprise when lights are falling\nIt's bound to reawake some primal calling\nIt hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright\nI'm only concerned with the way we end up\nI think I've been wrong enough to know when I'm right\nSo put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone\nIt hasn't been long enough""I got arrested in the dark of the night\nThe cop got restless as he read me my rights\nHe told me, I'm always envious of those that I jail\nIf I got locked up nobody come to help me post bail\nAnd I said oh!\nWent to a party on the side of a hill\nMet three Latinas who had gotten their fill.\nThey told me nobody ever gets us down on our knees\nSimply to help us take a load off our feet.\nAnd I said oh!\nAnd I'm never sure what I'm living for but it's always on

I had to ask why\nThat was the old me I was living a lie\nAnd I said oh!\nRiding the subway with the scent of her hair\nShe took out a toothbrush started using it there\nShe explained I'm always sure today's the day I will die\nI wanna look good if I get to look god in the eye\nAnd I said oh!\nAnd I'm never sure what I'm living for but it's always on my mind\nSomeone comes along always proves me wrong think im gonna be fine\nWe get lost in the back of our minds\nGot nothing to burn but time time time\nEverybody's got the love but they keep it inside\nMet an acquaintance we were reintroduced\nWith more in common than we had in our youth\nShe told me you look the same I said I'm now a new man\nShe asked me how does that work I started giving a damn\nAnd I said oh!""New life decides to come through the front door\nAnd makes us wish we'd shown respect before\nThough I don't have much of a choice\nI resolve to regain my voice\nChorus\nIf I only just begin to understand it that's because\nEverytime I time I start to change my mind again\nIt gets me back to where I was\nNew life we never had a clue\nThe two of us deciding what to do\nThough my hands are all but tied\nI rebound so I can say at least I tried\nChorus\nAnd long as I'm allowed I'll change my mind that's what it's for\nI'm getting older but I'm still the same I'm just thinking anymore\nChorus""Okay it's alright with me some things are just meant to be\nIt never comes easily and when it does I'm already gone\nI'm practically never still more likely to move until I end up alone at will\nMy life continues inching along\nWhen Bernadette comes I get lost on her tide\nShe's much too sweet and she's always gonna be\nWhen I return to her arms and her eyes\nIt might not be the same but it's alright with me\nOkay it's alright with me some people are scared to see\nWhat's happening frequently but I would never shy from a fight\nHeartbeat with a high demand often will go hand in hand\nBut I'm sick of just starting plans I wanna spend the rest of my life.\nWhen Bernadette comes I get lost on her tide\nShe's much too sweet and she's always gonna be\nWhen I return to her arms and her eyes\nIt might not be the same but it's alright with me""He's been waiting around for the weekend\nFiguring which club to sneak in\nFancy drinks and fifty dollar cover charge\nLately it's been a big hassle\nHeineken and new castle\nTo make sure he's fitting in and living large\nDisregard the lies that he will tell and what he's probably like\n'Cause it's not hard his charm is gonna get him through the night\nIf he wants to rock he rocks\nIf he wants to roll he rolls\nHe can roll with the punches long as he feels like he's in control\nIf he wants to stay he stays\nIf he wants to go he goes\nHe doesn't care how he gets there long as he gets somewhere he knows\nSee her heavy makeup and cut tshirt\nEvery girl out wants to be her\nBut they look the same already why adjust\nReading the magazine secrets\nForgetting the topical regrets\n'Cause if she comes home all alone the night's a bust\nIt's a must the swivel in her hips and the look she gives\nIt's all her trust if only in the morning she knew where she lived\nIf she wants to rock she rocks\nIf she wants to roll she rolls\nShe can roll with the punches long as she feels like she's in control\nIf she wants to stay she stays\nIf she wants to go she goes\nShe doesn't care how she gets there long as she gets somewhere she knows\nAnd in a wink they're on the brink\nFrom drink to drink and at the bar with cash to blow\nShot to shot it's getting hot\nAdvance the plot to see how far it's gonna go\nAll depends so ditch the friends and grab a cab\nAnother chance at cheap romance\nDoesn't count 'cause the room is spinning\nNothing to lose tonight they both are winning\nAnd they fall in love as they fall in bed\nIf they want to rock they rocks\nIf they want to roll they rolls\nThey can roll with the punches long as they feels like they're in control\nIf they want to stay they stay\nIf they want to go they go\nThey don't care how they get there long as they get somewhere they know""Call me crazy if you've got it in you\nBut these people don't seem to mind\nSweet vermouth now you're telling me the truth\nA little stubbornness will work out fine\nA bottom feeder at the end of my rope\nBut I'm wondering where this rope began\nGonna circle around what I couldn't help bring down\nIt's just supply with demand\nNothing looks the same\nEven when there's been no change\nSay that somethings gonna give\nAnd

mind of her own\nAnd she uses it well\nSo she invites me over outside villanova\nShe's got some pullout sofa that we won't hardly need\nShe is only drinking soda revving up that motor\nGot places we could go to but I still won't believe\nThat she's only gifted\nWhen I'm standing by her side\nShe goes unassisted\nAnd I start to relax as I cut her some slack\nChorus\nSo get up I gotta go to work\nFacing all these people who now know I'm a jerk\nAnd it's a setup I gotta change my clothes\nConcealing all this evidence before everybody knows\nWhat I've done and what I'm gonna do again\nAnd in the middle of the night I have a breakdown of sorts\nWith regret creeping in\nShe's gonna put up a fight and she will get her way\nCause she loves sleeping in\nSo I need someone to side with when she begins confiding\nAnd I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold\nShe says she's so excited to play some groom and bride\nWith me but I'm undecided so I need to be told\nThat she's only sinking\nWhen I'm sleeping by her side\nWith a change of thinking\nI could pull us away even just for a day\nChorus\nShe grows impatient to change my tune\nShe's geting older and legal soon\nAnd I wasn't ready to start out and go upsetting\nSome girl that I'd be forgetting\nBy the time the cops came by that afternoon\nAnd I try to decide as she pulls me aside\nChorus""Open my eyes and there you

I'm not as bad as Hitler but it doesn't mean a thing since they'd rather be with Hitler more than me I don't see why they'd rather be with Hitler more than me.""you called me up last night in

blahblahblah\nShe had  pants and a very big bra\nI took a couple of flicks and she was enthused\nI said, How do you like the show\nshe said, I was very amused\nI started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back midrange\nBut when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange\nThen when I asked, Do ya have a man, she tried to pretend\nShe said, No I don't, I only have a friend\nCome on, I'm

takes to get from here to there. My ribs that show through tshirts and these shoes I got for free I'm unconsoled, I'm lonely. I am so much better than I used to be. Terrified of telephones and shopping mall, and knives, and drowning in the pools of over lives. Rely a bit to heavily on alcohol and irony. Get clobbered on by courtesy, in love with love, and lousy poetry. And I'm leaning on a broken fence between Past and Present tense. And I'm losing all these stupid games that I swore I'd never play. And it almost feels okay. Circumnavigate this body of wonder and uncertainty. Armed with every previous failure, and amateur cartography, I breathe in deep before I spread these maps out on my bedroom floor. Leaving. Wave goodbye. Losing, but I'll try, with the last ways left, to remember. Sing my imperfect offering.""You don't always have to fuck her hard,\nIn fact sometimes that's not right to do,\nSometimes you got to make some love,\nAnd fuckin' give her some smoochies

clothes\nAnd when I wake this morning I'll get up put on these same clothes\nAnd I'll step into the sunlight and start walking in these same clothes\nAnd when the air turns cold and the clouds bring the rain\nThese clothes they will protect me 'till the skies clear up again\nAnd against the wind I'll button up the collar on these same clothes\nAnd when we first met I'm sure that I was showing off these same clothes\nAnd when I gave my heart to you I did so in these same clothes\nAnd before we first made love you pealed off each one from my skin\n'Till there was nothing left to keep you from coming in\nAnd you saw who I am in the absence of these same clothes\nWhen they get dirty I wash them with care oh these same clothes\nAnd when they lose a button oh they tear in these same clothes\nNow most days when I dwell on not what is but what is not\nI look at other people and all the clothes they've got\nUntil I realize I could have nothing but these same clothes\nAnd our children will know what it means to have a loving home\nBut there are things they will have to figure out on their own\nAnd I promise I won't ever try to make them wear these same clothes\nNo No\nOhh Ooo ooh\nOhh Ooo ooh\nOooh Ohh Do do do\nWhen I leave this world please separate me from these same clothes\nJust burn them into ash no one can ever wear these same clothes\nAnd if you knew me well you know how much I cherished you\nRemember that I wore these clothes the only way I knew\nAnd I was happy and I was blessed and how I loved to wear these same clothes\nYes I was happy and I was blessed and how I loved to wear these same clothes\nYeah I was happy and I was blessed and how I loved to wear these same clothes\nAlright Oooh ooh ooh\nAlright Oooh ooh ooh\nOooh ooh do do do\nOooh

what you miss more your desk or the hungry sky.\nThe Ambulance Angels pull up to the graveyard,\nand leave you there bubbling broken sonnets and shards.\nThe Ambulance Angels notify your next of

give in,\nJust remember we're coming back for your children.""Yesterday I shaved every inch of my body and mailed the hair to you.\nDoes this excite you\nIs this what you like, pen pal\nToday I mailed

on\nWho did you meet\nWhat did they say\nIs the world just a foxhole you watch from\nBrass boots saw the war we're winning dramatized on leering tv screens,\nBrittle moons breaking, giant swans pecking at all the free flesh.\nC'mon, c'mon, let's run to the cracked open sun.\nC'mon, c'mon, lets run to the tenstory gun.\nBrass boots saw those trencheyed preteens spraypainting fangs onto sanitized dreams\nRich, rich, blackbirds falling asleep in broken bottle hot tubs.\nBrass boots saw everybody laughing, saw everybody sleeping\nAnd death's grin grown men cleaving million dollar debts from the bank of their own skin.\nC'mon, c'mon, lets run to the cracked open sun.\nC'mon, c'mon, lets run.\nThe birds are burning down.""Wolf mechanics.\nThose wolf mechanics.\nToday you beat the

die, and angels don't take bribes.\nDon't linger on the skylgight you smashed between his eyes.\nJust run into the alley\nand tell jokes to the bricks and rats.\nBecause one man's murder scene is another's champagne party.\nOne man's butchered spine is a soldier's war decoration.\nThose wolf mechanics flare up again\nas you make your way back to the financial district.\nThe subway is a numb field.\nEvery dazed boy and girl makes you lick your lips.\nThe girl with the accordion, chewing grass like a lamb,\nshe hands you the juicy eye and then she laughs at your pathetic tie.\nBut don't linger on the grin you gouged in her throat.\nJust take the subway home.\nBut the wife and kids twinkle like stuffed dogs.\nYou're like the stormy ocean now,\ncollecting death like driftwood.""roll

blisterpack filled\nWith strong sleeping pills, and a bath of hot water.\nHe carefully wrote a funerary note\nOn his best writing paper to set out the facts,\nAnd sealed it with wax, and left it in the kitchen.\nHe left it out so his parents would know\nWhat there was waiting for them\nPale cold skin and blood seeping in to the landing carpet.\nHe said he's not for sale, said that he felt hounded,\nCrowded and surrounded by this life he didn't choose.\nBut everybody plays this game on a daily basis.\nThey're not heroes, they're survivors,\nAnd it's not Shakespearean if they lose.\nSo do what you want,\nDo what the voices tell you,\nBut don't ever say that we didn't warn you.\nHe said he's not for sale,\nBut he bought into his failure.\nHe's telling tales that hammer nails right into open palms.\nA martyr in reverse,\nHe's best at being worst,\nThe rest of us are cursed\nBut we keep calm and we carry on.\nSo Richard, here it is\nNone of us are blameless,\nHuddled here like

the state\nWe enter in a darkness whence we never shall escape\nWhen they raise their hands up our lives to possess\nTo know our souls, to drag us down, we'll resist.\nWatt Tyler led the people in \nTo meet the king at Smithfield and issue this demand\nThat Winchester's should be the only law across the land\nThe law of old King Alfred's time, of free and honest men.\nBecause the people then they understood what we have since forgot\nThat a government will only work for its own benefit\nAnd I'd rather stand up naked against the elements alone\nThan give the hollow men the right to enter in my home\nWhen they raise their hands up our lives to possess\nTo know our souls, to drag us down, we'll resist.\nStand up Sons of Liberty and fight for what you own\nStand up Sons of Liberty and fight, fight for for your homes.\nSo if ever a man should ask you for your business or your name\nTell him to go and fuck himself, tell his friends to do the same.\nBecause a man who'd trade his liberty for a safe and dreamless sleep\nDoesn't deserve the both of them, and neither shall he keep.""Moses was old, a chill in his bones.\nFalling apart, he knew in his heart that his time had

outweigh the pain.\nPaupers and kings, princes and thieves,\nSingers of songs, righters of wrongs, be what you believe.\nSo saddle your horse and shoulder your load,\nBurst at the seams, be what you dream, and take to the road.""A free house, a soundsystem and a fridge full of beer\nI've known how this story ends for a good few years.\nThe night lays out before my eyes, there's no new faces, no surprises.\nThis town is growing old with me, so I'm making a move.\nEverybody round here's been out with everybody else,\nWhich makes talking to girls hazardous to my health.\nThey've been in this genepool so long they've got wrinkled toes\nI don't want all her exes to be people I know.\nThere's millions more fish in the sea, so I'm making a move.\nI'm bored of this town, bored of this scene, bored of these people, yeah.\nI'm an expert at pretending that everything is OK,\nBut I'm just a kid and it seems as if I've signed my life away.\nI need to get out and see what the rest of the world is about.\nThis toen ain't big enough for the one of me, I'm making a move.\nEvery guy with long hair round here is a star,\nAccorinding to his girlfriend and the way that he holds his guitar.\nIf anyone gets out they stick in the knife, I don't want to get stuck here for the rest of my life.\nI'm sick of these fuckers, I'm moving on.\nI still want to be buried here, just like I said, but I'd prefer it if you'd wait until I'm actually dead.\nIt's easy to get caught inside a town that seems to have a hivemind,\nBut I'm packing up and moving on,\nWhen I move out from my parents' house I'm gone, yeah fuck you guys I'm gone.\nThis town ain't big enough for the one of me,\nSo why don't you get from in front of me\nWe're all going to move to london anyway, so I'll see you in town.""I have to admit that I am one of the many\nWho thought that a guitar would win him a lady\nMy teenage years, they were a feminine drought\nAnd I thought that a serenade would help out\nAnd it seemed to be working for a couple of years\nI wrote a few songs and they wrought a few tears\nBut when I hit my twenties, it ran out of steam\nI seemed to be suffering from romantic fatigue\nAnd I never know which song I should play her\nEach melody is a memory of a not forgotten failure\nSo when I get out my guitar tonight to do what I do\nRemember, I probably didn't write this song for you\nSo as I have mentioned, the shelf life was short\nThe scheme wasn't working despite what I thought\nThe ladies all left me alone in the end\nSo I had to switch all the names around and then sing it again\nAnd every life long love and every best friend\nSlipped away into the past\nTake my words with caution, I can't pretend\nThat you're the first, you won't be the last\nI never know which song I should play her\nEach melody is a memory of a not forgotten failure\nSo when I get out my guitar tonight to do what I do\nRemember, I probably didn't write this song\nNo, I certainly didn't write this song\nNo, I never, never wrote a song for you""I've been trying to find a way that I could say it you \nSay it you, all that I've been trying to say.\nI've been stuttering my way from here to anywhere \nAnywhere you can hear me stutter away.\nI've been longing for the day, when you would say Hey,\nI feel a little fragile today, and I was wondering if I could drop on by\nI've been talking to total strangers in the middle of the night,\nBecause I get so nervous when I dial your number\nThat I never quite punch it in right, in spite of me.\nSo I haven't been as strong as I had thought I'd be,\nBut I think I've been stronger than you would concede.\nSo let's do that exercise where you close your eyes\nAnd fall back onto me, and you will see I'm strong after all.\nI will lift you up if you'll lay me down.\nSo today could be the day when we both say Hey,\nI feel a little fragile today, and I was wondering if I could drop on by\nSo I won't be nervous when I dial your number in the middle of the night.\nI will clear my throat, then I'll sing this song,\nAnd I'll be out the door and round before the first of the new day's light.""Whatever happened to childhood\nWe're all scared of the kids in our neighboorhood\nThey're not small, charming and harmless,\nThey're a violent bunch of bastard little shits.\nAnd anyone who looks younger than me\nMakes me check for my wallet, my phone and my keys,\nAnd I'm tired of being tired out\nAlways being on the lookout for thieving gits.\nWe're all wondering how we ended up so scared\nWe spent ten long years teaching our kids not to care\nAnd that there's no such thing as society anyway,\nAnd all the rich folks act surprised\nWhen all sense of community dies,\nBut you just closed your eyes to the other sidev Of all the things that she did.\nThatcher fucked the kids.\nAnd it seems a little bit rich to me,\nThe way the rich only ever talk of charity\nIn times like the seventies, the broken down economy\nMeant even the upper tier was needing some help.\nBut as soon as things look brighter,\nYeah the grin gets wider and the grip gets tighter,\nAnd for every teenage tracksuit mugger\nThere's a guy in a suit who wouldn't lift a finger for anybody else.\nYou've got a generation raised on the welfare state,\nEnjoyed all its benefits and did just great,\nBut as soon as they were settled as the richest of the rich,\nThey kicked away the ladder, told the rest of us that life's a bitch.\nAnd it's no surprise that all the fuckups\nDidn't show up until the kids had grown up.\nBut when no one ever smiles or ever helps a stranger,\nIs it any fucking wonder our society's in danger of collapse""We were only supposed to go out for the night,\nBut it's been a few hours now since it got light \nWe're a mess, and the worst part is we couldn't care less.\nThere's water in the ashtray and ash in the sink,\nThe carpet's mostly soaking, but there's nothing to drink \nWe're a state, and we're starting to regret staying awake.\nAnd I'll pay for my sins when I get paid,\nI'll stop talking to girls when I get laid.\nI should have gone home when I could, but I stayed.\nBut then I never was the clever one.\nWe were only supposed to go out for the night,\nI did my best to go home but in the end I lost the fight with myself \nTo be honest I was hoping I'd go home with someone else.\nAnd right about now I should be starting my day,\nBut instead I am sat here downing the dregs of yesterday,\nAll the while trying to prop up both ends of my smile.\nAnd I'll pay for my sins when I get paid,\nI'll stop talking to girls when I get laid.\nI should have gone home when I could, but I stayed.\nBut then I never was the clever one,\nBut always the one to not see that I'm done and\nI need to go home and get to sleep,\nAlways the last to see the moment has passed and\nI need to admit my defeat.\nAnd I'm lonely  there, I said it.\nI'm lonely, but it's hard to admit it\nWhen everbody thinks that you're fine all the time and you're not.\nSo we were only supposed to go out for the night...\nBut who am I kidding Try as I might I can't stop\nUntil I've squeezed out every last drop.\nAnd I'll pay for my sins when I get paid\nBut I don't have a penny to my name.\nI'll stop talking to girls when I get laid\nBut I haven't had a shower for days.\nI should've gone home when I could but I stayed,\nAnd so I stay up alone,\nAnd set off on my own\nTo the station where I catch the first train.""I remember the day the day\nWhen I had to take you to the airport\nAnd put you on a plane\nAnd so you left me\nLeft me alone on an empty tube train\nDeep under the ground\nWhile you were bathed in sunlight\nHigh above the clouds\nI needed you here\nTo be my sunshine in London town\nCalifornia's had more than its fair share\nYou left me to these small skies\nAnd to rainsoaked concrete\nTo Morrissey and Robert Smith\nAnd complicated streets I know\nOn which you lost your patience and your way\nThe way you always did on steel gray rainy days\nI needed you here\nTo be my sunshine in London town\nCalifornia's had more than its fair share\nOf beating summer sun and shining seas\nBut it doesn't have a shred of honesty\nI know the truth, yeah, Neil Young\nAnd Joni Mitchell were Canadians\nI guess that makes sense, they had their fill\nAnd then they moved away again\nYou're not alone, we all sometimes\nUse words that we don't understand\nYour love was only just skin deep\nAnd in the end it gave me cancer\nYou might have been my sunshine\nBut I'd rather have a rainy day\nCalifornia gets just what it deserves""I check that I've got all my things before I leave the house,\nBecause when I'm gone I'm never coming back.\nI'm not being melodramatic, it's just I neither have your number or a key.\nAn evening spent pretending that we're just becoming friends,\nOr this goes any further than going back\nI'm not being pessimistic, it's just you and I were never meant to be.\nIt isn't love, but every time I kind of wish it was.\nI've picked up this silly habit in the last few years of going out\nIn the evening with my friends into the town,\nOf packing a spare Tshirt in my bag in case I do not make it home.\nIt's pathetic and I know it, but the truth is there've been mornings\nI've proved prudent taking toothpaste to the pub.\nBut that's precious little comfort against the knowledge of the person I've become.\nIt isn't love, but every time I kind of wish it was,\nAnd I can see that in your eyes you wish it was,\nBut every time I leave you just because\nIt isn't love.""It's been eighteen months since I kissed you once\nSo just saying hi just isn't going to fly\nBut if you give me a clue and a minute or two\nThen I might remember your name\nAnd I hate to insist that I was really that pissed\nBut to tell the truth, in my flush of youth\nI would drown my sight until faces\nAnd nights seemed the same\nAnd a nervous shrug and an awkward hug\nWon't get me out of the hole that I've dug\nSo I slip the noose with a poor excuse\nAnd talk to someone, anyone else\nAnd I sit with my friends and I try to pretend\nThat I never did that sort of thing again\nBut I'm lying to myself\nAnd suddenly it's as clear as clear could be\nI'm not quite the perfect man that I hoped I'd be\nAnd though I always tried to live an honest life\nTo tell my truth I've told my share of lies\nI remember you, of course I do\nBut I don't recall how many times we've been through\nThis little game, that always ends the same\nWith you sad and me far away and every time I repeat the line\nThat the fault's not mine and I wasn't unkind\nBut the worst part is that I've got nothing else to say\nAnd all the pretty little pictures of faith\nAnd firm devotion that I painted as a child\nWell they have fallen by the wayside\nAlong with all my puppy fat\nBut my days have taught me this\nThat every day I spend pretending\nThat I always choose the right path\nIs a day that I choose the wrong\nOh yes, my wisdom teeth have been giving me grief\nThey woke me up to find that I'm exactly the kind of\nGuy, I said that I'd rather be dead than be\nIn the days before I got laid""Blacking in and out in a strange flat in east London\nSomebody I don't really know just gave me something to help\nSet me down and stop me always thinking about you\nAnd you know your life is heading in a questionable\nDirection when you're off in days with strangers\nAnd you can't remember anything except way you sound\nWhen you told me you didn't know what I should do\nIt's a long road out to recovery from here,\nA long way back to the light\nA long road out to recovery from here,\nA long way to make it right\nAnd so I wake up in the morning just like every other day\nAnd just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain,\nAnd so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away\nBut you're not lying there any longer and I know\nThat it's my fault so I been pounding on the floor\nAnd I've been crawling up the walls and I've been divvying my darkness\nAnd Serotonin boosters, cider and some kind of smelling salts\nIt's a long road out to recovery from here,\nA long way back to the light\nA long road out to recovery from here,\nA long way to make it right\nSo on the first night we met you said well darling let's make a deal,\nIf anybody ever asks us well let's say that we met in jail\nAnd that's the story that I'm sticking to like\nA southern face that comforts but today I need to hear\nSome truth if I'm ever getting through this\nYea you once sent me a letter that said if I was lost at sea\nClose my eyes and catch a time idea and only think of me\nWell darling now I'm sinking I'm as lost as\nLost can be and I'm hoping you can drag me\nOff and down and out to my recovery\nIf you could just give me a sign and just a subtle little glimmer,\nA suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better\nThen I'd stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller all the time\n'Cause I know that you are cynical but I think\nI can convince you yea 'cause broken people\nCan get better if they really want to\nOr at least that's what I have to tell myself if I'm hoping to survive\nIt's a long road out to recovery from here,\nA long way back to the light\nA long road out to recovery from here,\nA long way back to whats right\nDarling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover,\nDarling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover,\nDarling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover,\nDarling, sweet lover, one day this will all be over""Just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather\nAnd I can fuck up anything, anything\nIt was a wonderful life when we were together\nAnd now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing\nAmelie

but still we had to part\nAnd if music was the food of love\nThen I'd be a fat romantic slob\nWell music, it's my substitute for love\nThe last girl that I loved she was a low and lusty liar\nShe set my heart on fire, but made me choke\nHer beauty was a sight to see, but she didn't save it all for me\nI found other fires by following the smoke\nI wish that she had either cared for me or\nLet me be\nBut she chased me from mind and from my home\nI wrote her  songs, but I ended up alone\nAnd if love is really all that we need\nThen even all my singing is never gonna save me\nMusic it's my

really fall in love\nAnd I could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to me""God dammit Amy, we're not kids any more.\nYou can't just keep waltzing out of my life,\nLeaving

that I made when I was a kid,\nWith a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,\nWhen I thought that suffering was something profound,\nThat weighed down on wise heads,\nAnd not just something to be avoided,\nSomething normal people dread.\nGod dammit Amy, well of course I've changed.\nWith all the things I've done and the places I've been\nI'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.\nBut you're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.\nYou're still trying to live like a kid, like you can always have it all.\nYou know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,\nThat I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,\nShowing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do\nThe telltale signs of being used,\nOf being trapped inside of you.\nYou're a beautiful butterfly\nBurned with a branding iron\nOnto my outsides into my insides\nAs a simple sign\nTo show off your ownership.\nBurned into my naked skin,\nOnto my outsides into my insides.\nIt's not even love any more,\nIt's just a claim upon my soul.\nIt stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,\nAnd I'm ashamed to get undressed\nIn front of strangers in case they see\nThe tell tale signs that you have left all over me.\nGod dammit Amy.\nYou'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.\nAnd it's not like it's something I think about each and every day \nI just occasionally catch myself scratching them, as if they'd ever go away.\nBut these tell tale signs are here to stay, and

redemption is mine and mine alone""Wandering lonely through the snow streets of New York\nI stumbled on a thrift store that sold postcards by the yard\nI bought a mile and shipped them home so I could read\nTen thousand tenword tragedies, the lives these strangers lead\nTo remind myself the things I need\nCause I once wrote you love songs\nYou never fell in love\nWe used to fit like mittens, but never like gloves\nYou left me feeling like\nWe'd never really been in love\nHuddled home up in my place, in Holloway\nI wondered if you ever heard those songs I used to play\nI wrote them as a gift for you and in return\nYou gave a pair of hand knit mittens to keep my fingers warm\nSo I could play more ignored love songs\nI once wrote you love songs\nYou never fell in love\nWe used to fit like mittens, but never like gloves\nAnd I once wrote you postcards\nYou never wrote back\nPromised me you would and I'm still waiting for them\nYou left me feeling like\nWe'd never really been in

refrain\nOh, my darling Armadillo\nLet me tell you of my love\nListen to my Armadillo roundelay\nBe my fellow on my pillow\nUnderneath this weeping willow\nBe my darling Armadillo all the day.\nI was somewhat disconcerted by this curious affair\nFor a single Armadillo, you will own, on Salisbury plain in summer, is comparatively rare\nAnd a pair of them is practically unknown\nDrawn by that mellow solo\nThere I followed on my bike\nTo discover what these Armadillo lovers would be like\nOh, my darling Armadillo\nHow delightful it would be\nIf for us those silver wedding bells would chime\nLet the orange blossoms billow\nYou need only say I will  oh\nBe my darling Armadillo all the time\nThen I saw them in a hollow, by a yellow muddy bank\nAn Armadillo singing....... to an armourplated tank\nShould I tell him, gaunt and rusting, with the willow tree above\nThis  abandoned on manoeuvres  is the object of your love\nI left him to his singing\nI cycled home without a pause\nNever tell a man the truth about the one that he adores\nOn the breeze that follows sunset\nI could hear that sad refrain\nSinging willow, willow, willow down the way\nAnd I seemed to hear it still, Oh\nVive l'amore, vive l'Armadillo\nBe my darling Armadillo all the day\nBe my darling Armadillo all the day""Wake up in the morning you feel out of place\nYou're a disgrace\nOnce more with resignation\nBut

age I won't be such a coward\nBut these day I sit at home, known to shout at my TV\nAnd Punk Rock didn't live up to what I hoped that it could be\nAnd all the things that I believed with all my heart when I was young\nAre just coasters for beers and clean surfaces for drugs\nAnd I packed all my pamphlets with my bibles at the back of the shelf\nWell it was bad enough the feeling, and the first time it hit\nWhen you realized your parents had let the world all go to shit\nAnd that the values and ideals for which many had fought and died\nHad been killed off in the committees and left to die by the wayside\nBut it was worse when we turned to the kids on the left\nAnd got let down again by some poor excuse for protest\nYeah by idiot fucking hippies in  different factions\nWho are locked inside some kind of 's battle reenactment\nAnd I hungup my banner in disgust and I head for the door\nOh but once we were young, and we were crass enough to care\nBut I guess you live and learn, we won't make that mistake again, no\nOh but surely just for one day, we could fight and we could win\nAnd if only for a little while, we could insist on the impossible\nWell we've been a good few hours

plan's set to get forming\nThen where's the harm spending an evening\nIn manning the old barricades,\nSo come on old friends to the streets\nLet's be  but not ,\nLet's be heroes, let's be martyrs, let's be radical thinkers\nWho never have to test drive the least of their dreams\nLet's divide up the world into the damned and safe\nAnd then ride to the valleys like the old life brigade\nAnd straighten our backs and we won't be afraid\nAnd they'll celebrate our deaths with a national parade""Our history runs down our rivers\nDown our rivers to the sea\nReminds us of the things that matter\nHome and heart and history\nAnd all our sins will be forgiven\nWashed away to set us free\nBy the rivers that run through our homesteads\nBy myth and modal melody\nI traced these rivers from the cities to the seas\nTo remind me of what I already know\nI traced the shorelines through a thousand histories\nTo remind me an island is my home\nAn island is my home\nI traveled far across this country\nNorthumberland to Southern Downs\nI wandered up the rolling Humber\nAnd down the Thames to London town\nAnd countless lives were lived and lingered\nIn the cotswells and the fells\nI left a tapestry called England\nAnd life and those who lived it well\nI traced these rivers from the cities to the seas\nTo remind me of what I already know\nI traced the shorelines through a thousand histories\nTo remind me an island is my home\nAn island is my home\nRound here the sky is a little closer\nA little closer to the ground\nIt's hard for someone to get lost here\nHarder still to get found\nAnd though I've seen a thousand rivers\nFrom the Mississippi to the Rhine\nThe only place that I'll lay my hat down\nIs by an English riverside\nI traced these rivers from the cities to the seas\nTo remind me of what I already know\nI traced the shorelines through a thousand histories\nTo remind me an island is my home\nAn island is my home\nSo place your trust into the sea\nIt's kept us safe for centuries\nIt shaped our shores and steadily\nIts care has brought us, come\nAnd when I die, I hope to be buried out in English seas\nSo all that then remains of me\nWill lap against these shores\nUntil England is no more""Many years back when the old oaks were young\nNot long after the Northmen had come\nA low and evil deed was done\nIn the dark of the New Forest\nIn the dark of the

ever forget\nYou were trading my drinks for acrossthebar winks\nLike some rumour that I haven't heard yet\nWhen I stumble onto you outside\nI said I was sorry but that was kind of a lie\nI've been waiting for you\nAnd I knew that you knew\nYou still laughed, you still acted surprised\nBridge\nAnd it's lamely ridiculous for me to be said that I'm sure\nBut if I had an apple to give\nThen it would be yours\nAnd the others would rage as I turned them away\nBut you've followed me down to the shore\nAnd for you I'd start a war\nSo darling, yes, I'm sure""As I walked out one morning fair,\nI found myself drawn thoughtlessly\nBack to the place we used to live,\nAnd you still do, now without me.\nAround the back, away from the road,\nBehind the bins, beneath your window,\nI found the hulk, the rusting bulk\nOf a shattered old piano.\nSomeone had torn out some of the keys\nWith cruel care, not thoughtlessly,\nIn such a way that one could only play\nMinor melodies.\nSo I sat down in my sadness, beneath your window,\nAnd I played sad songs on the minor keys of a broken piano\nA sinner amongst saved men on the banks of the muddy Thames.\nAs I have wandered through this city,\nLike a child lost in the London fog,\nFrom Highgate Hill, down to the river,\nThen washed downstream past the Isle of Dogs,\nI've had time enough to think upon\nThe question of what kind of songs\nThat you would choose to listen to\nNow that I am gone.\nAnd as I drift beneath that bridge,\nJust down the road from where you live,\nI've often thought I might have caught\nYour voice upon the wind.\nBut as I stroked those broken keys\nYou did not join in harmony.""In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream\nAt night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide

small words.\nAnd then I catch myself\nCatching your scent on someone else\nIn a crowded space\nAnd it takes me somewhere I cannot quite place.\nBut then I remember you,\nAnd the way you shine like

which came first\nThe house, the home, or the terrible thirst\nShe keeps having dreams\nAnd on the worst days\nWhen it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons\nShe's got her cowboy boots and car keys on the bed stand\nSo she can always run\nShe can get up, shower, and in half an hour she'll be gone\nI keep having dreams of things I need to do\nAnd waking up and not following through\nBut it feels like I haven't slept at all\nWhen I wake to a silence and she's facing the wall\nPosters of Dylan and of Hemingway\nAn antique compass for a sailor's escape\nShe says you just can't live this way\nAnd I close my eyes and I never say\nI'm still having dreams\nAnd on the worst days\nWhen it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons\nI sleep with my passport\nOne eye on the back door\nSo I can always run\nI can get up, shower, and in half an hour I'll be gone\nAnd come morning\nI am disappeared\nJust an imprint on the bedsheets\nI'm by the roadside with my thumb out\nA car pulls up, and Bob's driving\nSo I climb in\nWe don't say a word\nAs we pull off into the sunrise\nAnd these rivers of tarmac are like arteries across the country\nWe are blood cells alive in the bloodstream\nThe beating

schools\nThey can make you pay attention\nTo the way you dress and eat\nMake you trip over your own two feet and they\nKneel down on their towels at night\nTheir nightgowns glow with a Holy light\nAnd we pray for the sinners\nAnd their drunken car wrecks\nAnd vow that I'll never get high\nAnd have sex\nI'm a teen for God\nGod is watching, teen for God\nGod is watching, teen for God\nAnd God made

passion\nIs it only there to tame\nIt fills my heart and it calls my name and\nThis world that you made for us\nI know, I know, is dangerous\nSo I ride a lot of horses\nAnd I never even swear\nSorta like praying I'm just not there\nOh God\nGod is watching, oh God\nGod is watching\nBut God made love\nGod made the rivers run\nAnd cowboy boots and bathing suits\nAnd the boy's skin dries in the sun\nYou gotta help me, God\nHelp me know, four years from now\nI won't believe in you anyhow\nAnd I'll mope around the campus\nAnd I'll feel betrayed\nAll those guilty summers I stayed\nBut then I'll laugh\nThat I fell for the lure\nOf the pain of desire to feel so pure\nAnd I'll bear all the burdens\nOf my little daily crimes\nWish I had a God for such cynical times\nFar from today\nBut for now

After that, well, you just got the bars\nYou don't know how precious you are, walking around with your little shoes dangling\nI am the one who lives with the ocean.""I won't forget when Peter Pan came to my house, took my hand\nI said I was a boy I'm glad he didn't check.\nI learned to fly, I learned to fight\nI lived a whole life in one night\nWe saved each other's lives out on the pirate's deck.\nAnd I remember that night\nWhen I'm leaving a late night with some friends\nAnd I hear somebody tell me it's not safe, someone should help me\nI need to find a nice man to walk me home.\nWhen I was a boy, I scared the pants off of my mom,\nClimbed what I could climb upon\nAnd I don't know how I survived,\nI guess I knew the tricks that all boys knew.\nAnd you can walk me home, but I was a boy, too.\nI was a kid that you would like, just a small boy on her bike\nRiding topless, yeah, I never cared who saw.\nMy neighbor come outside to say, Get your shirt,\nI said No way, it's the last time I'm not breaking any law.\nAnd now I'm in a clothing store, and the sign says less is more\nMore that's tight means more to see, more for them, not more for me\nThat can't help me climb a tree in ten seconds flat\nWhen I was a boy, see that picture That was me\nGrassstained shirt and dusty knees\nAnd I know things have gotta change,\nThey got pills to sell, they've got implants to put in, they've got implants to remove\nBut I am not forgetting\nThat I was a boy too\nAnd like the woods where I would creep, it's a secret I can keep\nExcept when I'm tired, except when I'm being caught off guard\nI've had a lonesome awful day, the conversation finds its way\nTo catching fireflies out in the backyard.\nAnd I tell the man I'm with about the other life I lived\nAnd I say now you're top gun, I have lost and you have won\nAnd he says, Oh no, no, can't you see\nWhen I was a girl, my mom and I we always talked\nAnd I picked flowers everywhere that I walked.\nAnd I could always cry, now even when I'm alone I seldom do\nAnd I have lost some kindness\nBut I was a girl too.\nAnd you were just like me, and I was just like you.""I'm sorry that I left you\nWith your questions all alone\nBut I was too happy driving\nAnd too angry to drive home\nI was thinking about the easy courage\nOf my distant friends\nThey said I could let this bridge wash out\nAnd never make amends\nCan I blow this small town\nMake a big sound\nLike the star of a film noir postcard\nCan I just forget the frames I shared with you\nAnd I can't believe what they're saying\nThey're saying I can change my

shake my petals free\nI'm resolved to being born\nAnd so resigned to bravery\nYeah the one who leaves this also grieves this\nToo much rain on a prairie flood plain\nHouses floating, love is like that\nWe built on the river\nAnd that's to say, yeah I'm leaving\nBut I don't have to go there\nI don't have to go to Spring Street\n'Cause it's spring everywhere...""I never thought you were the

called her uncle\nSaid, We're up here for the holiday\nJane and I were having solstice\nNow we need a place to stay\nAnd her Christloving uncle\nWatched his wife hang Mary on a tree\nHe watched his son hang candy canes\nAll made with red dye number three\nHe told his niece, It's Christmas eve\nI know our life is not your style\nShe said, Christmas is like solstice\nAnd we miss you and it's been awhile\nSo the Christians and the pagans\nSat together at the table\nFinding faith and common ground\nThe best that they were able\nAnd just before the meal was served\nHands were held and prayers were said\nSending hope for peace on earth\nTo all their Gods and Goddesses\nThe food was great, the tree plugged in\nThe meal had gone without a hitch\nTill Timmy turned to Amber and said\nIs it true that you're a witch\nHis mom jumped up and said\nThe pies are burning, and she hit the kitchen\nAnd it was Jane who spoke, she said\nIt's true, your cousin's not a Christian\nBut we love trees, we love the snow\nThe friends we have, the world we share\nAnd you find magic from your God\nAnd we find magic everywhere\nSo the Christians and the pagans\nSat together at the table\nFinding faith and common ground\nThe best that they were able\nAnd where does magic come from\nI think magic's in the learning\n'Cause now when Christians sit with pagans\nOnly pumpkin pies are burning\nWhen Amber tried to do the dishes\nHer aunt said, Really no, don't bother\nAmber's uncle saw how Amber looked like\nTim and like her father\nHe thought about his brother\nHow they hadn't spoken in a year\nHe

when we push ourselves ahead,\nWe push ourselves ahead.\nAnd it was cloudy in the morning\nAnd it rained as you drove away\nAnd the same things looked different\nIt's the end of the summer\nIt's the end of the summer,\nWhen you move to another place\nAnd I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same\nShe walked alone all spring,\nShe had a boyfriend when the summer came\nAnd he gave her flowers in a lightning storm\nThey disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn\nAnd sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving\nSo when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves\nShe held on to his sleeves\nAnd she doesn't want to let go\n'Cause she won't know what she's up against\nThe classrooms and the smart girls\nIt's the end of the summer\nIt's the end of the summer\nWhen you hang your flowers up to dry\nAnd I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head\nIt felt like the first day of school\nBut I was going to the moon instead\nAnd I walked down the hall\nWith the notebooks they got for me\nMy dad led me through the house\nMy mom drank instant coffee\nAnd I knew that I would crash\nBut I didn't want to tell them\nThere are just some moments when your family makes sense\nThey just make sense\nSo I raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on\nWe walked out on the dark and frozen grass\nThe end of the summer\nIt's the end of the summer\nWhen you send your children to the moon\nThe summer ends and we wonder who we are\nAnd there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car\nAnd today I passed the high school, the river, the maple tree\nI passed the farms that made it\nThrough the last days of the century\nAnd I knew that I was going to learn again\nAgain, in this less hazy light\nI saw the fields beyond the fields\nThe fields beyond the fields\nAnd the colors are much brighter now\nIt's like they really want to tell the truth\nWe give our testimony to the end of the summer\nIt's the end of the summer,\nYou can spin

the beauty of the rain\nIs how it falls, how it falls, how it falls\nAnd there's nothing wrong but there is something more\nAnd sometimes you wonder what you love her for\nShe says you've known her deepest fears\n'Cause she showed you a box of stainedglass tears\nIt can't be all, the truth about the rain\nIs how it falls, how it falls, how it falls\nBut when she gave you more to find\nYou let her think she'd lost her mind\nAnd that's all on you\nFeeling helpless if she asked for help\nOr scared you'd have to change yourself\nAnd you can't deny this room will keep you warm.\nYou can look out of your window at the storm\nBut you watch the phone and hope it rings\nYou'll take her any way she sings\nOr how she calls, the beauty of the rain\nIs how it falls, how it falls, how it falls\nHow it falls, how it falls, how it falls""Yea, there was a time I didn't like the love, I liked the climbers,\nI was no sister then, I was running out of time and one liners,\nAnd I was afraid,

of women, I will not be afraid of women.\nSo now were at a club, you watch the woman dancing, she is drunk,\nShe is smiling and shes falling in a slow, descending funk,\nAnd the whole bar is loud and proud and everybody's trying, yeah.\nYou play the artist, saying, Is it how she moves, or how she looks\nI say, its loneliness suspended to our own like grappling hooks,\nAnd as long as shes got noise, shes fine.\nBut I could teach her how I learned to dance when the musics ended,\nOh, and thats not petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,\nI will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.\nYou tried to make me doubt, to make me guess, tried to make me feel like a little less,\nOh, I liked you when your soul was bared, I thought you knew how to be scared,\nAnd now its amazing what you did to make me stay,\nBut truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going,\nAnd so Im leaving, you can find out how much better things can get,\nAnd if it helps, Id say I feel a little worse than I did when we met,\nSo when you find someone else, you can try again, it might work next time,\nYou look out of the kitchen window and you shake your head and say low,\nIf I could believe that stuff, Id say that woman has a halo,\nAnd I look out and say, Yeah, shes really blond,\nAnd then I go outside to join the others, I am the others,\nOh, and that's not easy, I don't know what you saw, I want somebody who sees me,\nI will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.""Oh, what have we here, he must be three or

but who's counting\nHe couldn't find anyone who wanted to party\nSo he walked around a playground with a bag of Mickey's Tallboys\nAnd he heard the sound of laughter and he followed it for fifteen blocks\nThere was a house between Mavis and Water\nThey were out on the porch, they were inside playing quarters\nAnd he said, Don't you know the game Kazaam It's a better game,\nYou point your elbow at someone and say somebody else's name\nAnd it alternates whose turn it is and if you lose you drink.\nThey said Man, you really make us think,\nYeah you make us think and so\nTonight we're gonna be the party\nWe will party all night long\nWe are the party generation\nSo have a seat, what's in the bag\nParty on.\nRound about one or two it started winding down\nAnd he knew what they needed they needed donuts\nSo they walked out to Krispy Kruller's All night Sugar Palace\nIt was there in the doorway he said, Oh, well maybe not.\nInside there were six women talking\nThey were the most justified angry exgirlfriends\nAnd they swivelled around slowly like they saw something bad\nThrough the eyes in the back of their heads\nLike he always knew they had\nAnd they said, What a coincidence, and Hey, you're just the man,\nWe were saying that you did the best you could\nYou're fine, we understand and so\nTonight we're gonna be the party\nWe will party all night long\nWe are the party generation\nYou were the best but we'll survive\nParty on.\nIn the morning they sent him home with a designated driver\nAnd he lay down and thought about the whole night\nAnd he looked up at the photo that he bought at a junk shop\nIt was only fifty cents but he framed it and everything\nIt was the kind of party that you hope never ends\nThe lucky party boy surrounded by his friends\nAnd they were all in pointed hats\nCaught in a rebel birthday shout\nAnd he was at the candles with his mom there to help him out\nThere was a lot that you could learn if you lay near them\nLike if you listened you could hear them and he could hear them\nThey say,\nTonight we're gonna be the party\nWe will party all night long\nWe are the party generation\nSo lift your head and blow 'em out\nTonight we're gonna be the party\nWe will party all night long\nWe are the party generation\nSo lift your head lift your head\nParty on""Well the mountain was so beautiful\nThat this guy built a mall and a

love\nWhen you feel your soul go beyond your skin\nWhen you know that's the way that it's always been\nHey, what do you love more than love\nHey, what do you love more than love\nWell, I climbed a

shines like endless holy days\nStruggling to remember what they're celebrating\nWell, a God descended\nAnd the reason ended\nHis life was lifted just above the law\nAnd now we have to live with what we did\nWith what we saw\nWell, you mend your clothes and patch your roof\nAnd slivers of God's shattered truth\nGrow tender as the grass in cleanswept yards\nBut a savior came and told us how\nThe truth was all around us now\nAbandon house and field and gather up the shards\nWell, a God descended\nAnd the reason ended\nHis life was lifted just above the law\nAnd now we have to live with what we did\nWith what we saw\nWell, you build your faith with strength and duty\nBuild your love but there's a beauty\nWell you know the scriptures tell\nThere are a few shards left in hell\nAnd if we want a god we had to follow, follow him down\nPictures torn out of their frames\nAnd orgies where we lost our names\nAll were gone with time's real desire\nWell, you ask how God can curse you thus\nThat's not a question asked by us\nWe burned our beds and books\nWe fear we've lost the fire\nThe God descended\nAnd the reason ended\nHis life was lifted just above the law\nAnd now we have to live with what we did\nWith what we saw.""If you're gonna get your heart broke, you better do it just right,\nIt's gotta be raining, and you gotta move your stuff that night,\nAnd the only friend you can reach

blessings, at the moment I was most alone\nAnd aimless as a fulltime fool, the joke was on me,\nI got all those birds flying off of that tree, and that's a blessing.\nAnd the blessings were like poets that we never find time to know,\nBut when time stopped I found the place where the poets go.\nAnd they said, Here have some coffee, it's straight, black and very old,\nAnd they gave me sticks and rocks and stars and all that I could hold,\nI had the blessings, a moment of peace even when the night ends,\nYeah, the blessings, can we meet Can we meet again,\nAt the crossroads of disaster and the imperfect smile,\nWith the angel in the streetlamp that blinks on as I walk on a mile, the blessings.\nAnd the best ones were the ones I got to keep as I grew strong,\nAnd the days that opened up until my whole life could belong,\nAnd now I'm getting the answers, when I don't need them anymore,\nI'm finding the pictures, and I finally know what I kept them for,\nI remember, I can see them, see them smiling, see them stuck,\nSee them try, I wish them luck and all the blessings.\nI was fast asleep at three in the morning when I got the payphone call,\nAnd she said, Did I wake you up, I said, Hey, no, not at all.\nAnd she said, I got this suitcase and I don't know what to pack,\nAnd I said, You can take anything you want, just wait and see,\nIt's not a release, not a reward, it's the

this boat is worth scarce a mention\nI think of the crew, most of all the first ensign\nFor all we learned the sea\nGuiding a ship, it takes more than your skill\nIt's the compass inside it's the strength of your will\nThe first ensign watched as tempests all tried me\nI sang in the wind as if God were beside me\nFor all we learned the sea\nYou take the wheel one more time like I showed you\nWe've reached the strait once even I could not go through\nI am the captain and I have been told\nBut I am not shaken, I am eight years old\nAnd you are still young, but you'll understand\nThat

everywhere they go\nHiding in my car and running in the snow\nRunning with the friends they'll know for years\nI've seen it all from here, from here\nIt happens every day, before they go to school\nThey play until the bus drives up beside my lawn\nAnd there's always been a mother who waits 'til they are gone\nThen she turns away\nIt happens every day\nNoon comes and turns this campus upside down\nI watch the students in this college town\nYou would think they're carefree, I have seen their trials\nFrowning into Shakespeare and practicing their smiles\nEven underlining Nabokov\nWhen I am not in love, in love\nIt happens every day with their journals in cafes\nLooking up at their reflection on the other wall\nWith every new idea wondering if they've changed at all\nAnd then they look away\nIt happens every day\nWell life is as hard and as easy as they say\nWalking the steps we've chosen on this day\nSome will be outrageous, some have rarely shown\nSome will walk in couples, some will walk alone\nAs I think about the world I see\nThey stare and smile at me, at me\nIt happens every day at the crossing of the street\nWalking out to see what's new and what is just the same\nAnd the only word for love is everybody's name\nAnd that will always stay\nIt happens every day\nAnd every day will happen without you""Go ahead push your luck\nFind out how much love the world can hold\nOnce upon a time I had control and reined my soul in tight\nWell the whole truth\nIs like the story of a wave unfurled\nBut I held the evil of the world\nSo I stopped the tide\nFroze it up from inside\nAnd it felt like\nA winter machine that you go through and then\nYou catch your breath and winter starts again\nAnd everyone else is spring bound\nBut when I chose to live\nThere was no joy it's just a line I crossed\nIt wasn't worth the pain my death would cost\nSo I was not lost or found\nAnd if I was to sleep\nI knew my family had more truth to tell\nAnd so I traveled down a whispering well\nTo know myself through them\nGrowing up my mom had a room full of books\nAnd hid away in there\nHer father raging down a spiral stair\nTill he found someone most days his son\nAnd sometimes I think my father, too, is a refugee\nI know they tried to keep their pain from me\nThey could not see what it was for\nBut now I'm sleeping fine\nSometimes the truth is like a second chance\nI am the daughter of a great romance\nAnd they are the children of the war\nWell the sun rose\nWith so many colors it nearly broke my heart\nIt worked me over like a work of art\nAnd I was apart of all that\nSo go ahead push your luck\nSay what it is you gotta say to me\nWe will push on into that mystery\nAnd it will push right back\nAnd there are worse things than that\n'cause for every price and every penance that I could think of\nIt's better to have fallen in love\nThan never to have fallen at all\n'cause when you live in a world\nWell it gets in to who you thought you'd be\nAnd now I laugh at how the world changed me\nI think life chose me\nAfter all""Can you fix this It's a broken heart.\nIt was fine, but it just fell apart.\nIt was mine, but now I give it to you,\nCause you can fix it, you know what to do.\nLet your love cover me,\nLike a pair of angel wings,\nYou are my family,\nYou are my family.\nWe stood outside in the summer rain,\nDifferent people with a common pain.\nA simple box in that hard red clay,\nWhere we left him to always remain.\nLet your love cover me,\nLike a pair of angel wings,\nYou are my family,\nYou are my family.\nThe child who played with the moon and stars,\nWaves a snatch of hay in a common barn,\nIn the lonely house of Adam's fall\nLies a child, it's just a child that's all, crying\nLet your love cover me,\nLike a pair of angel wings,\nYou are my family,\nYou are my family.""Once upon a time there was a nuclear family,\nAnd we lived in a family time,\nAnd we'd unite in a family way.\nAnd off in the ancient mountain,\nThey were splitting every nucleus.\nThey said, Don't be alarmed,\nJust don't try this at home.\nAnd they were the mystery that made the world run\nAnd we had the power, 'cause they were the sun\nAnd we called them our heroes, and the future had come.\nThey said, Look at the light we're giving you,\nAnd the darkness we're saving you from.\nSoon they were bringing it into our showroom,\nAnd they'd unveil it with it's title,\nBring your family, bring your family,\nIt's the great unknown.\nYou can look, but you can't fathom,\nIt's the Great Unknown.\nI'm no ordinary princess,\nI was born in the Cold War,\nAnd my team is the Rockets,\nGo team, it's a dangerous time\nAnd I dream of the moon and building lunar clone colonies.\nAnd I build my peace with strength,\nThat's the best weapon you've got.\nOh, I am the brainchild, I am the mortar,\nWith a plastic trophy and an eating disorder,\nAnd vision as big as a great big wall,\nAnd they tell me that I'll move forward\nFor the good of us all,\nAnd the good of nuclear families all.\nAnd they think I think I am important.\nI know I never was, no, I wasn't.\nNo, I never, and how could I be\nIt's the great unknown.\nNow we've built it, now it's ticking,\nIt's the great unknown.\nAnd I am your children, I am millions\nAnd I wanted to sell out, I wanted to try,\nBut the sky got too low\nAnd the ocean got too high.\nAnd I tried to take God into my own hands\nAm I too late Is it over\nHave I sacrificed my family to the great unknown\nThere's a war between my conscience and the great unknown.\nSo I walked out into the gamma fields\nOut in Mercury, Nevada.\nWhere I stood in circle,\nAnd that circle started to pray.\nAnd the wind at the nuclear test sites\nFloats the data of the radiation.\nFrom the underground testing,\nCross the line, you'll get arrested.\nAnd we came from all over in a silent appeal\nAs the drill comes down like a presidential seal.\nAnd we stand for the living, and we stand for the dead,\nAnd we looked out to see your enemies,\nAnd we see that you're looking all at us instead.\nAnd you think I am being disruptive\nBut no, I'm running home, I'm running,\n'Cause I'm trying to put the atom back together.\nIt's the great unknown.\nI'm just trying to put the atom back together.\nIt's the great unknown.""I heard love can fall so hard, it can bury a kingdom\nI heard it makes the spring appear out of season\nIt's a storm in a shadowbox, a force to be reckoned with\nWhen it finds you and find you, it will\nAnd I'd never believe it 'til I loved, I love\nThe rivers sing and stars awaken above me\nAnd the wind and the moon in fits of restless conspiring\nTurn night to heaven for you\nBut I am going to a far, far land\nI know it sure as I've a past and a future\nWith my maps on the table, you see I have lost many things\nSo many, I won't turn back\nAnd were I a deadwood ship, my heart a compass\nI would leave with inanimate grace, no love could touch me\nBut I live and I know that I'll burn as I grow\nThough it may break my heart to walk away""Ron and Nancy got the house but Sid and Nancy rule\nI died eight years ago I'm still a legend at my high school\nI stole a Chevy and I wrapped it round a tree\nBut that's OK 'cause no one's gonna make the next century\nI'm up in heaven now they say I'm here to stay\nWhere the clouds are really puffy and the angels sing every day\nAlleluia\nThe cafeteria's got everything, it's gonna drive me mad\nCause it looks just like a big Hawaiian party that my mother had\nIt's like the worst Elvis film I've ever seen\nTechnicolor luau all on technicolor green\nThere's camping trips and donkey rides and singing round the fire\nAnd they signed me up for surfing\nBut they can't get me in the choir\nAlleluia\nBut there she was this morning getting fitted for her wings\nLeather boots, magenta hair, and saying nasty things\nI'd say she was an angel but it's stupid and it's obvious\nI said you'll hate it here 'cause we're the only ones like us\nIt's cryptofascist mania, it's silicon deliria\nYeah, she said, you're right, but I like the cafeteria\nAlleluia\nHey God, we're the bad kids, we're so nasty, mean and vile\nGod looks like a guidance counselor, God's got that smile\nGod says, how could this be, that's really odd\nI guess I'll have to check my records, silly me, you know, I'm only God\nAlleluia""There's a part of the country could drop off tomorrow in an earthquake,\nYeah, it's out there on the cutting edge, the people move, the sidewalks shake.\nAnd there's another part of the country with a land that gently creaks and thuds,\nWhere the heavy snows make faucets leak in bathrooms with freestanding tubs.\nThey're in houses that are haunted, the with kids who lie awake and think about\nAll the generations past who used to use that dripping sink.\nAnd sometimes one place wants to slip into the other just to see\nWhat it's like to trade its demons for the restless ghost of Mrs. Ogilvey,\nShe used to pick the mint from her front yard to dress the Sunday pork,\nSometimes southern California wants to be western New York.\nIt wants to have a family business in sheet metal or power tools,\nIt wants to have a diner where the coffee tastes like diesel fuel,\nAnd it wants to find the glory of a town they say has hit the skids,\nAnd it wants to have a snow day that will turn its parents into kids,\nAnd it's embarrassed, but it's lusting after a SUNY student with mousy brown hair who is\nTaking out the compost, making coffee in long underwear.\nAnd southern California says to save a place, I'll meet you there,\nAnd it tried to pack up its Miata, all it could fit was a prayer,\nSometimes the stakes are bogus, sometimes the fast lane hits a fork,\nSometimes southern California wants to be western New York.\nTempe, Arizona thinks the Everglades are greener and wetter,\nAnd Washington, D.C. thinks that Atlanta integrated better,\nBut I think that southern California has more pain that we can say,\n'Cause it wants to travel back in time, but it just can't leave L.A.\nBut now I hear they've got a theme park planned, designed to make you gasp and say,\nOh, I bet that crumbling mill town was a booming mill town in its day,\nAnd the old investors scoff at this, but the young ones hope they'll take a chance,\nAnd they promise it will make more dough than Mickey Mouse in northern France,\nAnd the planners planned an opening day, a town historian will host,\nAnd the waitresses look like waitresses who want to leave for the west coast.\nAnd they'll have puttering on rainy weekends, autumn days that make you feel sad,\nThey'll have hundred year old plumbing and the family you never had,\nAnd a Hudson River cleanup concert and a bundlebearing stork,\nAnd I hear they've got a menu planned, it's trs western New York.""My dad's a miracle and so's my mom.\nThey fly over the blue.\nThey finish their dinner and then they take one another's hand.\nAnd off they go to find a broader point of view.\nFor it's a give and take beyond the ordinary.\nWhat with all the cats and kid's that they've loved.\nAnd they will not be alone.\nMy friends give me purple flowers and orange tea\nOn goosedown spilling quilts and turquoise chairs\nWe greet each other in a wild profusion of words\nAnd wave farewell amidst the wonderment of air\nAnd in the laughing times we know that we are lucky\nAnd in the quiet times we know that we are blessed\nAnd we will not be alone\nWell, the light that stopped the night felt like forgiveness to you\nAs the garbage trucks came bustling through their rounds\nYou stared at the pictures on your wall and all the postcards from your friends\nAs you heard the birds and old familiar sounds\nAn that's when you knew this world can't be saved, only discovered\nAnd you knew things could be different than before\nAnd you will not be alone anymore""She never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City\nThe cold comes though every crack she puts her hand up to\nThe radiator's broken, so she has to use electric heat.\nAnd tonight was the first date with the brother of the guy she worked next to\nHe lived a couple streets away\nHe listened, he had things to say\nShe asked him up for dinner sometime\nSometime was tonight\nThe radio gave updates on the ice storm while she made the dinner\nThey said, from all the talk, you shouldn't drive or even walk\nAnd this just in, we're asking everyone to turn off their power\nThey need it at the hospital.\nShe ran around pulling plugs, then she called him up\nMaybe now they shouldn't meet, he said that he would brave the streets\nShe met him at the door with a blanket and a candle\nSaying, I heard it on the radio, I had to turn my power off.\nHe said you're not the only one, the streets were dark tonight,\nIt was like another century\nWith dim lamps and candles lighting up the icy trees and the clouds and a covered moon.\nShe said what kind of people make a city\nWhere you can't see the sky and you can't feel the ground\nI tell you something, I have this feeling that this city's dying\nHe said, it's not dying it's the people who are dying\nShe said, yes, yes I think the people are dying and nobody cares.\nWe had all this technology our dreams were bold and vague\nAnd then one city got bad planners, one city got the plague.\nHe asked why did you move here She said, for the job\nFor the job and I've been so lonely here, so lonely\nThere's no one I can talk to, you know I don't even know your brother.\nHe smiled and said, sometimes at night I walk out by the river\nThe city's one big town, the water turns it upside down\nPeople found this city because they love other people\nThey want their secretaries, they want their power lunches.\nAnd think about tonight, I heard the same newscast you did\nI unplugged everything, I looked out the window\nAnd I think the city heard, I watched as one by one the lights went off\nSo they could give their power to the hospital\nThey ate in silence while she thought this over,\nThey sat together in a dark room in the Mortal City\nShifting in their blankets so they wouldn't get spaghetti on them.\nThen came the awkward moment after dinner, what to do,\nThe ice was still falling, the streets were still dangerous\nThe cabs were not running and this neighborhood was not the greatest.\nThey both looked at the space where a couch would've been\nShe felt her stomach sink, she felt like she could hardly think\nShe said, I never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City\nThe cold comes through eve crack I put my hand up to\nThe radiator doesn't work, I have to use electric heat.\nThat settled it, they would both sleep in her bed\nIt was a matter of survival.\nShe brought out tshirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants, socks, hats\nIf there was ever any thought of what would happen in that bed tonight\nThere was no question now\nThey could barely move\nThey were wrapped up like ornaments waiting for another season.\nThey lay in bed, they listened to the pelting ice\nHe said my brother's not a bad guy, he's just quiet\nI wished you liked this city\nShe said, maybe I do.\nI think I have a special kind of hearing tonight\nI hear the neighbors upstairs\nI hear my heart beating\nI hear one thousand hearts beating at the hospital\nAnd one thousand hearts by their bedsides waiting\nSaying that's my love in the white gown,\nWe are not lost in the Mortal City\nWe are not lost in the Mortal City""You gotta admit life magazine made  look great,\nMy father said it sucked, everybody died.\nAll the troops you couldn't save, no one knew how to be brave,\nHe said sometimes you were afraid to turn your radio on.\nIt was enough to make you quit that peacenick scene.\nWell I heard about leaders, yeah I hear they're no longer around\nCause peace was abandoned, and bravery hanged in his town.\nAnd they passed down a sentence\nFor building on the beauty of some dream.\nAll my heroes are dead, I got them in my head, saying\nNever again, never a war, no more fighting.\nSo I'll stay true to them, and they'll come home again,\nI'll carry the light, follow the dream, I'll remember.\nThe ' convention was a singing the times they are achanging,\nWell I guess they achanged back.\nOh I miss those peaceful folk, love and humor when they spoke, hey\nPhil ochs you still sound great, should've stuck around to hear it.\nThey say that compact disc makes songs come true.\nBut phil I never expected that I'd miss you like a friend,\nCause I never expected that we would be marching again.\nAnd the soldiers of peace would tumble from this life as in a war.\nAll my heroes are dead, and all the books I read,\nSaid this is greed, this is wrong, fight your war at home.\nSo I'll stay true to them, and they'll come home again,\nI'll carry the light, follow the dream, I'll remember.\nSo back to the present passion, romance, love, or simply put a lack thereof.\nShall we go on\nI don't take it personally, it's our postmodern history,\nYou know since nixon was impeached it's just been hard to commit,\nSo we cast our allegance left and right.\nBut I always believed that our souls would come through.\nSo I never expected that you'd take her home with you.\nAnd I never detected, how hardened and not sorry you could be.\nDon't you know\nAll our heroes are dead, we got ourselves instead.\nAnd oh my friend, all your lies, they won't do you.\nYou gotta stay true to them, and they'll come home again,\nI miss them too, I miss them too, you know I miss them\nMore than I love you.""Come lovers, come loners, remember yourselves\nAs lusty tempestuous fools\nWhen your dream was to conquer an ocean\nFrom your small secretarial

alive\nAll we ever know is that the tourists survive.\nTra la, tra la, they say, they say\nLet's Go Pompeii.\nI think about Pompeii when I feel an end is near,\nJust before the rain and every time you disappear.\nAnd I think about a teacup, suspended and halfserved.\nAnd all the scholars know is that it's perfectly preserved.\nThat's all they say.\nThis was Pompeii.\nAnd as for my own kingdom, not a table leg was charred\nI simple lost my kingdom 'cause I held it much too hard\nOnce I had a sadness, the sadness turned to trust\nThe trust turned into ashes and to lawyers and dust\nA century, a
